# visualizing_beethoven_oeuvre

A personal side project aiming to visualize the complete works of Beethoven, focusing on changes in key selection over time.

This project is featured in a [series of "tutorials" on my Medium](https://medium.com/@mzhang13/visualizing-beethovens-oeuvre-part-i-scraping-and-cleaning-data-from-imsl-77ecb124002d), which goes into much further detail about the project and the different motivations behind it.
